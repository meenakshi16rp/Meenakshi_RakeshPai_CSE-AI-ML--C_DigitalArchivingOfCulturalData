Archive Mosaic - Cultural Heritage Digital Platform
Overview
Archive Mosaic is a secure, scalable, and user-friendly digital platform built to archive and preserve diverse forms of cultural heritage. It enables users and organizations to upload, categorize, and store traditional dances, music, art, manuscripts, and other culturally significant materials. Our platform ensures that these valuable assets remain accessible, organized, and protected for future generations.

Features Implemented ‚úÖ
1. User Authentication
Firebase Authentication is used for secure sign-in and sign-up.

Role-based Access Control:

Users are assigned roles (user or admin) upon registration.

Role-based dynamic routing ensures users are directed to the appropriate dashboard.

Session Management:

Secure sessions managed using JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for encrypted authentication.

2. User Management
User Dashboard:

Submit new cultural artifact records (images, videos, PDFs).

Edit or delete only their own submissions.

Admin Dashboard:

View all users and their uploads.

Edit or delete any user account.

Manage user roles (upgrade user to admin, restrict access).

3. Uploading and Metadata
Upload Page:

Supports images, videos, and PDFs.

Allows manual metadata entry (e.g., title, description, author, category).

MongoDB:

All uploads and metadata are securely stored in a MongoDB database.

4. Media Gallery
Gallery Page:

Displays uploaded artifacts.

Responsive and user-friendly design.

Filtering and Search:

Users can search and filter uploads based on metadata fields.

5. AI Integration
Image Captioning Model:

Integrated meta-llama/Llama-Vision-Free model via Together API.

Automatically generates structured image captions (Title + Description) during upload.

Captions are stored alongside manual metadata to enrich the archive.

6. Password Recovery
Forgot Password Feature:

Secure password reset link sent via email.

Allows users to create a new password safely.
